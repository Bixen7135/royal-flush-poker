## üèóÔ∏è Development Process

### Design Philosophy
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on creating an intuitive and engaging user experience
- **Performance First**: Optimized for fast loading and smooth gameplay
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across all devices
- **Accessibility**: Following web accessibility best practices

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Component Structure**
   - Modular components for reusability
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Common components library for consistency

2. **State Management**
   - React hooks for local state
   - Firebase for real-time state synchronization
   - Context API for global state where needed

3. **Styling Approach**
   - Tailwind CSS for rapid development
   - Custom utility classes for specific components
   - Responsive design patterns
   - Custom animations for enhanced UX

## ü§ù Trade-offs and Decisions

1. **Framework Choice**
   - Chose React for its robust ecosystem and component-based architecture
   - TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience
   - Vite for faster development and build times

2. **Styling Solution**
   - Selected Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistency
   - Custom animations with Framer Motion for smooth transitions
   - Trade-off: Larger CSS bundle size for better development speed

3. **Backend Selection**
   - Firebase for quick setup and real-time capabilities
   - Trade-off: Less control over backend infrastructure
   - Benefit: Faster development and built-in scalability

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Performance**
   - Initial load time might be slow due to large asset loading
   - Solution: Implement lazy loading and code splitting

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Some animations might not work smoothly in older browsers
   - Solution: Progressive enhancement and fallbacks

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - Touch interactions might need refinement on some devices
   - Solution: Ongoing testing and optimization

## üîÆ Future Improvements

1. **Features**
   - Tournament system
   - Chat functionality
   - Player statistics and leaderboards
   - Custom avatar system

2. **Technical**
   - Implement WebSocket for real-time game updates
   - Add unit and integration tests
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Implement PWA capabilities
